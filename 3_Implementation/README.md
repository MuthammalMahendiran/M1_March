# **NATURAL GARDEN**

* Structure store the order number, number of plants and cost.
* under the main function while loop is executed 
* while loop is used to repeatedly run the code until a condition is met.

* A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list.
    * Switch statement rules:
      * The expression used in a switch statement must have an integral or enumerated type, or be of a class type in which the class has a single conversion function to         an integral or enumerated type.
      * You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.
      * The constant-expression for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a constant or a literal. 
      * When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.
      * When a break statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.
      * Not every case needs to contain a break. If no break appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.
      * A switch statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of         the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.
* Based on choosing of item code the switch case will be excecuted and printed the details of plants.
